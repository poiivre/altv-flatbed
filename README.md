## Flatbed Towing for Alt:V Servers 

Tired of clunky towing mechanics on your Alt:V Server? Say no more! With this plugin, you can tow and untow vehicles effortlessly while cruising in your flatbed. Just hit 'G' and let the towing adventure begin!

- **G for "Go":** Tow and untow with ease using the 'G' key while chilling in your flatbed.
- **No Limits:** One player, multiple flatbeds! Each player can now tow multiple flatbeds to different vehicles, maximizing efficiency.

Made with love and tailored for Alt:V Server 4.0-rc1 (rc). 

⚠️ **Important Note:** While this plugin works like a charm for Alt:V Server 4.0-rc1 (rc), I've hung up my GTAVRP coding hat. Sadly, I won't be updating it to the newest versions of Alt:V.
